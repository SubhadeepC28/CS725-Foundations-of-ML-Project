# CS725-Foundations-of-ML-Project
This repository contains the report, code and presentation files for our project done in fulfilment of course requirements for CS725, Foundations of ML, offered by IIT Bombay 

### Project Title: Zero-shot Learning in Text Classification

### Project Description: 
We provide a brief overview of the Zero-shot learning paradigm, a classification technique that equips the model to predict classes it has never seen before in its training phase. This novel method makes use of semantic information transfer from external sources such that the trained model can make use of this external information to predict the unseen classes. A few references to this domain of classification technique have been mentioned in the report and the presentation as well.
